<p><em>For v 0.0.2</em></p>

<ul>
<li>[DONE] Move jQuery title input filed background icon declarations into css rules, so that we are simply changing class attributes, and not declaring full paths to icon gifs.
&#8211; We&#8217;ve found that this isn&#8217;t always possible, as some field are locked by js during the ajax cycle, and so styles cannot be applied to them at those times. JS is able however to &#8216;reach in&#8217;, so we&#8217;re sticking to this route for the spinner, especially.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For v 0.0.3</em></p>

<ul>
<li>[DONE] Add a filter to the responses they can be modified</li>
<li>[DONE] Add Activation hook for PHP Version check to activation and message on failure</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For v 0.0.4</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>[DONE] Consider how to handel very short queries </p></li>
<li><ul>
<li>https://wordpress.org/support/topic/causing-huge-mysql-queries/</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Handel very short queries - on user side JS?, with an alert abut very short queries (less then 3 char?) and reveals a &#8216;force search&#8217; button in the notice?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Nope, we just did it with a text in the php, and a truncated response prior to the actual query. Not as preferment but pretty quick to implement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[DONE] Correct space/tab code style issues.</p></li>
<li><p>[DONE] Add option in admin to limit searches in a custom post type to its own type (What is the use case for this?, not sure its really needed).</p></li>
<li><p>[DONE] Add a reminder to update the url slug in the response?</p></li>
<li><p>[WONT_IMPLEMENT] When a post title is found to be a close duplicate (similar_text()), it is automatically converted to draft status.</p></li>
<li><p>[WONT_IMPLEMENT] Consider adding the option to suspend autosave on all activated post types as an option in admin</p></li>
<li><p>[DONE] Added the ability to extend the error output to include other fields as needed (add filters).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>For v 0.0.5</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Added all strings are included in pot file.</li>
<li>Roll ajax detector function into its own class so that we can extend it.</li>
</ul>

# Duplicate Detector  

Adds a the ability to detect duplicate titles in posts, pages and custom post types.

Duplicate Detector settings allow you to activate any custom post-types, by default it is enabled on posts and pages.
Here you may also isolate searches for a particular post-type, to within that post-type. For example, a search for a duplicate title with the 'widgets' custom post-type would only return results for other widgets. Conversely, when 'widgets' is isolated, it will be omitted from searches from a post or page duplicate search.

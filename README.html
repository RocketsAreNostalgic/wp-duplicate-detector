<h1 id="duplicatedetector">Duplicate Detector</h1>

<p>Adds a the ability to detect duplicate titles in posts, pages and custom post types.</p>

<p>Look to the WordPress settings for Duplicate Detector to activate the post-types you would like DD to be active on.
You can now also isolate searches for a particular post-type, within that post-type. For example, a serach for a duplicate title with the &#8216;widgets&#8217; custom post-type would only return results for other widgets, not posts, pages etc.</p>
